# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview ##
This analysis serves to explain and visualize the Pyber Ride Sharing company's overall operations and revenues. The analysis filters the company's data by 3 levels of city type: urban, suburban and rural; and, considers such parameters as number of drivers/rides per city and type, overall fares, and fares per ride or per driver. <br /> <br />
## Results ## 

Below is an overview summary of Pyber's business operations. <br />

This chart clearly shows that as the city increases in distinction from Rural towards Urban the Total Rides, Drivers and Fares increases significantly, while the average Fares per Ride and per Driver become significantly less. Considering population density and ease of access, this makes sense as there are more people who would need rides in a more densely populated place, and the more rural the more spacious a city's layout thus increasing the length of any rides and driving up (pardon the pun) the price of the average fare. <br />
While the average fare per ride in Urban cities is much less than in Rural or Suburban, it is clear that Urban cities provide greater revenue than Rural and Suburban cities combined. The figure below clarifies these assertions by demonstrating the quality of the rides analyzed per type of city.
